# 
# I've started with `maxlend=0` (see below) in which the description was ignored. I then moved to start with a high `LR` and the manually lowering it. I also started with `nflips=0` in which the original headlines is used as-is and slowely moved to `12` in which half the input headline was fliped with the predictions made by the model (the paper used fixed 10%)

# if description is shorter than `maxlend` it will be left padded with `empty`
# if entire data is longer than `maxlen` it will be clipped and if it is shorter it will be right padded with empty.
# 
# labels (`Y`) are the headline words followed by `eos` and clipped or padded to `maxlenh`
# 
# In other words the input is made from a `maxlend` half in which the description is padded from the left
